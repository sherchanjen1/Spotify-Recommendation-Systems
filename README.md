## Overview
This project investigates:
- Factors contributing to music success (e.g., popularity, acoustics, tempo).
- A recommendation system designed to suggest music based on patterns in the data.

The analysis is performed using Jupyter Notebook and Python libraries such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **scikit-learn**.
